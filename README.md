# worst to best os ui/ux
## (in the opinion of nodemixaholic)
* Any version of an OS that doesnt function (Due to bug, or just bad coding, etc. One example would be the original GEMS EXP made in RustLang)
* GEMS (I know it's shit because I made it.)
* Any version of GEMS programmed in C# (GEMS NT, etc.) ***NodeMixaholic Approved form of computer AS WELL AS human torture)***
* temple os (full of 4chan users in the community)
* any fsf approved desktop distro (shit)
* gentoo (compile everything so installs take so long i cant handle it)
* arch (holds your hand a bit during install, but full of elitists)
* debian (hard to install due to me having devices with either realtek or intel wifi, as well as nvidia graphics)
* googled android (spies and user hostile as well as bugs)
* telekin (reminds me of vista mixed with xp with a hint of linux but on speed)
* windows 11 (swallows and rides and spies, tool coming soon...) ***NodeMixaholic Approved, if you dont mind being spied on...***
* linux mint (because no snaps)
* windows 10 (boring/spies unless you run my tool) ***NodeMixaholic Approved, if you use my tool. (WindowsBetterify)***
* mac os (cuz boring and slightly less spyware) ***NodeMixaholic Approved***
* chrome os (yawn...) ***NodeMixaholic Approved, if you dont mind being spied on...***
* iPadOS/iOS (because essentially shrunk down macOS but better privacy if you disable stuff,less privacy if you leave everything enabled like a normie, and less features) ***NodeMixaholic Approved, if you dont mind the possibility of being spied on...***
* lineage os (fourth best os, but do not install opengapps)
* windows vista (misunderstood due to most hardware not supporting it at the time, and most computer users not being savvy.)
* pop!\_os default (fun) ***NodeMixaholic Approved***
* windows xp (because its a classic its so good and stable once you get it running) ***NodeMixaholic Approved***
* degoogled android **not lineage** (close third best mobile os)
* calyx os (because its the best mobile os lol, only issue is because its somewhat unstable when it comes to gservices, but its getting better.) ***NodeMixaholic Approved***
* windows 7 (peak fucking windows, all went to shit from here.) ***NodeMixaholic Approved***
